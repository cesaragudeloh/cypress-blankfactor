# Cypress Automation: Blankfactor Website

This project is an end-to-end (E2E) automation test using **Cypress**, written with **Gherkin syntax**, and structured following the **Page Object Model (POM)**. It also leverages advanced interactions like `realHover()` to mimic real user behavior.

```

## Automated Flow

The scenario covers the following steps:

1. *Visit the Blankfactor homepage*
2. *Navigate to the Industries > Retirement and Wealth section*
3. *Scroll to the “Powering innovation in retirement services” section*
4. *Hover over the "AI & Machine Learning" card*
5. *Copy and log the card’s back-side text*
6. *Click the _Let's get started_ button*
7. *Assert the URL and page title of the Contact page*

## Advanced Features

-  `cy.realHover()`  
  Used to simulate real hover actions on animated cards (`flip-card`) that respond to mouse movements.

- `cy.get('@copiedCardText')`  
  Uses aliases and `.invoke('text')` to capture dynamic content from the DOM.
